## Features

`dpymenus` is an unofficial add-on for the `discord.py` library that lets you quickly compose various styles of menus
which react to user input.

- Handles text & button input, normalization, and validation
- Easy-to-build menus with paginated data, multiple choices, and polls
- Template system for quickly defining a cohesive style for your menus
- User-defined callbacks & event hooks for complex use-cases
- Awesome examples and documentation to get rolling quickly

## Quick Start

```pip install dpymenus```

Read **["Installation"](https://dpymenus.com/installation.html)** from **[The Book](https://dpymenus.com)** for further information.

## Examples

```python
from discord.ext import commands
from dpymenus import Page, PaginatedMenu


class Demo(commands.Cog):
    def __init__(self, client):
        self.client = client

    @commands.command()
    async def demo(self, ctx: commands.Context):
        page1 = Page(title='Page 1', description='First page test!')
        page1.add_field(name='Example A', value='Example B')

        page2 = Page(title='Page 2', description='Second page test!')
        page2.add_field(name='Example C', value='Example D')

        page3 = Page(title='Page 3', description='Third page test!')
        page3.add_field(name='Example E', value='Example F')

        menu = PaginatedMenu(ctx)
        menu.add_pages([page1, page2, page3])
        await menu.open()


def setup(client):
    client.add_cog(Demo(client))
```

The **[examples directory](https://github.com/robertwayne/dpymenus/tree/master/examples)** contains working examples for
almost every feature of the library.

In addition, the chapter on **["Examples"](https://dpymenus.com/installation.html)**
walks you through setting up the built-in example runner.
